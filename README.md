# What is URL?
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is the address used to locate and access resources on the internet. A URL is a string of characters that provides a standardized way to specify the location of a web page, file, or any other resource on the internet.

# What is URL Encoding/Decoding?
Encoding- URL encoding, also known as percent-encoding, is the process of converting special characters and non-ASCII characters into a standardized format that can be safely transmitted and interpreted within a URL. URL decoding is the reverse process, where encoded characters are converted back to their original form.

Decoding- URL decoding is the process of reversing this encoding. When a URL is received, the encoded characters are converted back to their original form. For example, "%20" is decoded as a space, "%21" as an exclamation mark, and "%2B" as a plus sign.

Conclusion- URL encoding/decoding is commonly used in web development when working with URLs, especially when passing data as query parameters. It ensures that special characters and non-ASCII characters are correctly transmitted and interpreted, maintaining the integrity of the URL and the data it represents.
